- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified missing JSDoc on exported items.
  2. Added appropriate @param, @returns, @example tags.
- **Things to test**: Check that documentation is properly formatted; ensure no breaking changes.

### TypeScript 'any' Warnings Fixed
- **Main error cause**: Implicit 'any' types in function parameters and destructured props causing TypeScript warnings.
- **How and where fixed**: Added proper type annotations and interfaces.
  - Added props interface and typed parameters in `components/accounts-list.tsx`
  - Added props interface and typed parameters in `components/transfer-form.tsx`
  - Imported necessary types from `@/types`
- **Step by step short description**:

  2. Added React and type imports.
  3. Defined props interfaces with proper types.
  4. Typed function parameters (e.g., React.FormEvent, Account).
  5. Used toInt() for Int type conversions.
- **Things to test**: Run TypeScript check again to confirm no 'any' warnings; verify component functionality.

### Restored File
- **Main error cause**: Missing `components/budget-tracker.tsx` file that was needed for app functionality.
- **How and where fixed**: Restored the file from git history commit fbe437e70bf834943eb3939a7a0a2c0e81abf987.
  - File was deleted in commit 017e411af8dd5f0884452704006d9236fb58c616 as "chore: add types and remove unnused file"
  - Restored to `components/budget-tracker.tsx`
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Investigated git history for deleted files.
  2. Identified `components/budget-tracker.tsx` as the removed file.
  3. Retrieved file content from parent commit using `git show`.
  4. Created the file with the original content.
- **Things to test**: Verify build succeeds; check if the component needs to be imported for app functionality.

### Hydration Mismatch Fixed
- **Main error cause**: Server-side rendered HTML didn't match client-side rendered HTML, causing hydration errors with theme toggle and language detection.
- **How and where fixed**: Updated theme and language providers to prevent hydration mismatches.
  - Added `disableTransitionOnChange` and `storageKey` to ThemeProvider in `app/layout.tsx`
  - Modified LanguageProvider in `contexts/language-context.tsx` to read initial language from localStorage synchronously
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified hydration mismatch in theme toggle button (title and icon differences between server/client).
  2. Added `disableTransitionOnChange` to prevent theme changes during hydration.
  3. Updated language context to use localStorage for consistent initial state.
  4. Ensured server and client start with the same language/theme state.
- **Things to test**: Check that app loads without hydration warnings; verify theme and language switching works correctly.

### Theme Toggle Hydration Mismatch Fixed
- **Main error cause**: Theme toggle button rendered different title ("Modo Claro" vs "Modo Oscuro") and icon (sun vs moon) on server vs client due to theme and language state differences.
- **How and where fixed**: Added mounted state to prevent dynamic rendering until after hydration in `app/page.tsx`.
  - Added useState for mounted and useEffect to set it true after mount.
  - Conditionally rendered dynamic title and icon only when mounted.
  - Added diagnostic logs to validate theme, title, and icon on render.
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified theme state mismatch between server (defaultTheme="dark") and client (localStorage).
  2. Added mounted state to delay dynamic content rendering.
  3. Used mounted flag to show static content during SSR, dynamic after hydration.
  4. Included console logs for debugging theme values.
- **Things to test**: Load app and check console for consistent theme logs; verify no hydration errors; test theme switching functionality.

### Empty accounts array not falling back to defaults in localStorage loading
- **Main error cause**: When loading data from localStorage, if accounts array was empty or undefined, it wasn't falling back to default accounts, causing app to have no accounts.
- **How and where fixed**: Added fallback check in `hooks/use-budget.tsx` at line 60 in the localStorage loading useEffect.
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified that parsedData.accounts needed validation for empty arrays.
  2. Added condition to check if accounts exist and have length > 0 before using them.
- **Things to test**: Load app with empty localStorage; verify default accounts are created; test with corrupted localStorage data.

### NaN amount causing error in addTransaction due to lack of validation
- **Main error cause**: addTransaction function didn't validate input amounts, allowing NaN values to cause calculation errors and app crashes.
- **How and where fixed**: Added validation check in `hooks/use-budget.tsx` at line 245 in the addTransaction function.
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Added isFinite check for amount parameter.
  2. Return early if amount is NaN or invalid.
- **Things to test**: Attempt to add transaction with NaN amount; verify error is handled gracefully; test with invalid string amounts.

### DailyBudgetApp.tsx Fixes
- **Main error cause**: Various issues including typo in translation key, unused imports/components, missing JSDoc, commented code, and type mismatch.
- **How and where fixed**: In components/DailyBudgetApp.tsx
  - Fixed typo 'asddsd' to 'history' on line 125
  - Removed unused AddButton import on line 20
  - Removed unused AddButton component on line 181
  - Added JSDoc comments to DailyBudgetApp component
  - Removed commented-out useCurrency line
  - Fixed type mismatch by importing toInt and converting startAmount in setupBudget call
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified issues in debug analysis.
  2. Fixed typo in translation key.
  3. Removed unused imports and components.
  4. Added JSDoc for documentation compliance.
  5. Cleaned up commented code.
  6. Fixed type mismatch with proper conversion.
- **Things to test**: Verify translation works, no unused code warnings, JSDoc renders correctly, app functions without type errors.

### General Standards
- **Indentation**: Code uses 2 spaces, rule requires 4 spaces. Not fixed due to scope.
- **Secrets**: No hardcoded secrets found.
- **Responsiveness**: Tailwind classes with sm:, md:, lg: breakpoints are used appropriately.

### Hydration Mismatch Error Fixed
- **Main error cause**: Hydration mismatch due to inconsistent theme state between server and client rendering in the theme toggle button.
- **How and where fixed**: Implemented mounted state pattern in app/page.tsx to render dynamic theme content only after component mounts.
- **Step by step short description**: Added useState for mounted flag, useEffect to set mounted to true after mount, conditionally render dynamic title and icon only when mounted.
- **Things to test to prevent this happening again**: Check browser console for consistent theme logs, verify no hydration warnings, test theme switching, confirm app loads without errors in both modes.

### Uncontrolled Input to Controlled Input Error Fixed
- **Main error cause**: A component is changing an uncontrolled input to be controlled caused by conditional value prop in setup-form.tsx.
- **How and where fixed**: Changed value={startAmount || undefined} to value={startAmount} on line 53 in components/setup-form.tsx.
- **Step by step short description**:
  1. Identified conditional value prop causing uncontrolled to controlled input change.
  2. Changed value prop to always be defined.
- **Things to test to prevent this from happening again**: Test input behavior with different startAmount values; verify no React warnings; check form submission works correctly.
